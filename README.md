Version 2.0 of my website; A complete overhaul!
=========

Doing a redesign of my personal website, making it prettier and more functional. 

I'd like to thank the internet for its vast resources and tutorials for helping me build this (so far). Couldn't have made it look so awesome without you.

Stuff I used:
For the carousel, I used Slick, by Ken Wheeler

I also built off of and tweaked a lot of code from Codrops and their awesome design elements.

And of course, thank you to everyone at StackOverflow, I don't know what I would do without you.
