Version 2.0 of my website; A complete overhaul!

Doing a redesign of my personal website, making it prettier and more functional. If you want to see v1, go to http://cjang5.github.io

I'd like to thank the internet for its vast resources and tutorials for helping me build this (so far). Couldn't have made it look so awesome without you.

Stuff I used:
For the carousel, I used Slick, by Ken Wheeler

I also built off of and tweaked a lot of code from Codrops and their awesome design elements.

And of course, thank you to everyone at StackOverflow, I don't know what I would do without you.
